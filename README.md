## Overview
Application that lets a user enter a location, and then shows weather and hiking information for that location. This app uses API keys to gather information. 

## Getting Started
1. Build out API servers, targeting the specific information you want to return to the user
1. deploy to heroku
1. create local server to store relevant nformation from APIs
1. move local server to heroku

## Architecture
- This application uses the following APIs:
  - Google Maps Geocode API
  - Weatherbit Weather API
  - Hiking Project Data API
- Location data is cached in a SQL database for future retrieval. 

## Change Log
